The tabs for line #5 should be 1, so that might be 2, 4, 8, idk spaces. You can't type nothing because there's no readline functions, so it can't get your wonderful input. If you get something different, open an issue or email me at gnuoveryou@gmail.com, but please open an issue before emailing me, I don't check it often.
## Todo
- [x] Make basic code
- [x] Make it work
- [ ] Create readline lib
- [ ] Probably debug that
- [ ] Make builtins work
- [ ] Probably debug that
- [ ] Add other basic stuff
- [ ] Debug that too
- [ ] Add scripting
- [ ] Throw my computer out the window
- [ ] Get a new one
