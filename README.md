You should get something like this:

We jumped up on the table
And shouted "ANARCHY!"


        Welcome to TAANSH: This Ain't A Normal SHell
youcanttypeanythingyetbecauseihavetoaddreadlinefunctions:-$ 
I feel like putting this here: $_$
```
The tabs for line #5 should be 2, so that might be 2, 4, 8, idk spaces. You can't type nothing because there's no readline functions, so it can't get input.
## Todo
- [x] Make basic code
- [x] Make it work
- [ ] Create readline lib
- [ ] Probably debug that
- [ ] Make builtins work
- [ ] Probably debug that
- [ ] Add other basic stuff
- [ ] Debug that too
- [ ] Add scripting
- [ ] Throw my computer out the window
- [ ] Get a new one
